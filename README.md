# BetterDiscordBridge

This plugin enables you to link your Velocity Network to Discord! 
The intent is to provide a lot of configurable and customizable options to allow you the format you want!


## Features
- Send all messages from the servers connected to velocity to one Discord channel.
- Have all servers connected to your Velocity to send to there own Discord channel.
- Limited placeholder values / Currently just enough to get the project kicking.

# TODO
- Add more placeholder values that can respect Nicks, prefixes, suffixes.
- Fix seralization error with sending msg's to the server.
- Update the name of plugin.
- Combined the plugins features with https://github.com/AnvilPowered/Catalyst

Combining this plugin with AnvilPowered/Catalyst is to continue the "All in one package" that Catalyst offers.
I'll still want to keep this plugin as a standalone for those who would like it that way.

## Setup

We have a setup guide on here: https://github.com/Bennyboy1695/BetterDiscordBridge/wiki/Setup
That will help you do the basic steps needed to get the plugin up and running.

## Pull Requests
This is an open source project!
Pull requests are always welcomed no matter how big or small!

## NOTICE
Please keep in mind this is not my project and that I am only using this project to get better with developing with Java for Minecraft.
I choose this plugin because It is something that I think everyone running a proxy should have and this project has more potential then what most might see.
I've seen many big name minecraft networks with this kind of feature to find out they had a developer on there end leaving us normal people with out any of the fun stuff.
It's time we break that gap and give that fun stuff to the community.
