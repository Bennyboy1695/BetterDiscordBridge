A Velocity proxy discord bridge plugin like none other.

## About BetterDiscordBridge

BetterDiscordBridge is a Minecraft <--> Discord bridge and vis versa, built on the velocity api 1.1.0.

On top of being just another Mc Discord bridge, BetterDiscordBridge was designed with multiple servers in mind.

Here's how:
- All velocity connected servers can send messages to one Discord channel. {Global}
- All velocity connected servers can send messages to individual channels per server. {Separate}

Instead of hassling with putting a discord plugin in each server with there own bot accounts,
BetterDiscordBridge is only one bot with high potential to grow and become something great. 

You've most likely seen a lot of big Minecraft Networks that have this feature and we plan
to give that feature back to the community.


## Future plans & Ideas

- LuckPerms support for Groups, Prefix, Suffix.
- [x] Update to Velocity-Api 1.1.0
- ReCode Bot Status Command.
- [x] Update plugin libs & dependencies
- Add more commenting to assist with always understanding the code
- Think of new ways to make the plugin even better
- Update & Add more detailed guides to the wiki
