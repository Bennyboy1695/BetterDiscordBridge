A Velocity proxy discord bridge plugin like none other.

*Plugin name has yet to be approved by the owner of this project.*

## About Viscord

Viscord is a Minecraft <--> Discord bridge and vis versa, built on the velocity api 1.1.0.

On top of being just another Mc Discord bridge, Viscord was designed with multiple servers in mind.

Here's how:
- All velocity connected servers can send messages to one Discord channel. {Global}
- All velocity connected servers can send messages to individual channels per server. {Separate}

Instead of hassling with putting a discord plugin in each server with there own bot accounts,
viscord is only one bot with high potential to grow and become something great. 

You've most likely seen a lot of big Minecraft Networks that have this feature and we plan
to give that feature back to the community.
